# Prime Numbers
A simple program for me to discover Qt. 

It can be easily adapted to any other GUI framework, just by changing the `WindowInterface` class instance handled by the controller. 

To run it, you need :
* CMake >= 3.6
* *(Windows)* MinGW
* Qt (installed and configured)

Steps:
1. Build with CMake. 
2. Run created executable (the target name is PrimeNumbers). 

NB: I used CLion to execute it. If you use CLion as well, I suggest not to use CLion's "run" button because it generates an error code while loading Qt.
